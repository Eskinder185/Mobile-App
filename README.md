I developed an Inventory App to help businesses track and manage their stock more effectively. This app was designed to meet the needs of warehouse employees, managers, and suppliers by providing real-time insight into stock levels, enabling quick stock updates, and sending alerts when items run low.

User-Centered Design
The app includes a login screen for secure access, a dashboard for an at-a-glance view of inventory and alerts, an item management screen to add and edit items, and a feature for sending low-stock notifications. Every screen is arranged so that important actions are easy to find, and I used simple labels and straightforward navigation to ensure users can complete their tasks quickly. This focus on clarity made the app more comfortable for people who may not be tech-savvy.

Coding Approach
I coded the app in Java using Android Studio, relying on clear class structures and comments to keep everything well-organized. I used an SQLite database for storing user information and inventory data, allowing for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. This structured approach will be useful in future projects because it keeps the code clean, maintains data security, and simplifies debugging.

Testing and Validation
To make sure the code worked correctly, I tested each feature in the Android Emulator. Frequent testing helped me catch small bugs before they became bigger problems. This process was important because it showed areas where the interface could be improved or where the code could break under unexpected inputs.

Innovation and Challenges
During development, one challenge was balancing simplicity with all the needed functionality. I adjusted the navigation flow and used a clear data model to handle multiple user roles and real-time alerts without complicating the interface.

Highlight
My strongest work is seen in the database and notification system. Users can store items, adjust quantities, and receive messages when stock runs low. This feature demonstrates my ability to combine database handling, user interaction, and real-time notifications in a single, user-friendly package.
